# Edmonton-House-Pricing-Estimation

Welcome to our Edmonton House Pricing Estimation project completed in R. The main objectives were to estimate the house prices in Edmonton, AB during the year 2015 and to predict whether the house prices would rise or fall from the year 2015 to 2016.

The first objective can be considered as a regression estimation problem. Our team utilized various regression machine learning methods such as multiple linear regression with optimization through regularization methods via ridge regression and the lasso. In future consideration, we could also apply ensemble methods such as random forests or boosting with regression trees for a more robust estimation fit.

The second objective can be considered as a classification problem. Our team used classification methods such as logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machines.

In future consideration, we could also apply ensemble methods such as random forests or boosting with trees for a more robust estimation fit. The use of deep learning neural networks via python modules such as TensorFlow is also a promising approach for increased estimation and prediction performance.

The entirety of our team's hard work has been summarized into an easy-to-follow presentation contained within the repository. The R code and the Edmonton house pricing data set are also provided.

Thank you and I hope this project shows, even in the slightest, the vast potential of machine learning.

Regards,

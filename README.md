# Edmonton-House-Pricing-Estimation

Welcome to our Edmonton House Pricing Estimation project. The main objectives were to estimate the house prices in Edmonton, AB during the year 2015 and to predict whether the house prices would rise or fall from the year 2015 to 2016.

The first objective can be considered as a regression estimation problem. Our team utelized various regression machine learning methods such as multiple linear regression with optimaization through regularization methods via ridge regression and the lasso. In future consideration, we could also apply ensemble methods such as random forests or boosting with regression trees for a more robust estimation fit.
